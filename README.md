# MusicStoreEF

This Repository is intended to practice how to work with Entity Framework Core. This project will use a strict Layered Architecture and RESTful API endpoints.

# Shown now
- Only the Layered Architecture, to an extent

## Future expected work
- Show full app logic using EF Core InMemoryDatabase
- Have a feature branch to show how migrating to a real Database would look
